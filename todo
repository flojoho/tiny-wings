dec: how to realize ground collision?
  working solution: check if velocity vector intersects any of the ground segments (treat player as point for now)
  option: figure out how circle/sement collision works
  option: just check if player object is below the terrain surface ()

collision response
  friction/collision dampening
    complete removal of normal component?

increase gravity on keypress (space? and/or keydown?)

minimum velocity in x-direction (or other solution that achieves the same thing)

air resistance?
