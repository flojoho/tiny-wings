mvp: gravity, model player as point, elastic collision, (no controls, no auto velocity, fixed camera)


dec: how to realize ground collision?
  mvp: check if velocity vector intersects any of the ground segments (treat player as point for now)
  option: just check if player object is below the terrain surface
    player could pass through terrain peaks this way though (not such a big deal for an mvp though)


dec: treat player as point object or circle?
  if circle: figure out how circle/sement collision works




collision response
  mvp: elastic collision
  working solution: multiply normal component of velocitiy vector with constant factor? (0 < c < 1)
  option: complete removal of normal component?

increase gravity on keypress (space? and/or keydown?)

minimum velocity in x-direction (or other solution that achieves the same thing)






air resistance?
